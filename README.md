> Each "patron" will have their own profile page to include: bio, blogs, avatar, and donation button.
> Using a [STRIPE](https://stripe.com/) API key, incorporate a safe & secure option for end users to donate to said patrons. (Include a "publishable" key as well as a "secret" key)
> Incorporate: React (front end), GraphQL w/ Node & Express, MongoDB (queries & mutations), Polished UI, Heroku (deployment), Authentication (JWT), Interactive, Mobile (scaleable), Donation (secure donate button)
